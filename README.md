# CalciumImaging
Analysis of Calcium Imaging data during different sleep states defined by EEG and EMG measurements. 
Please send an email to n.calcini-at-neurophysiology.nl or to antoine.adamantidis-at-dbmr.unibe.ch for the relevant publication to cite for this code or questions.

Start the toolbox (UI) with the "CalciumImaging_GUI.mlapp" file. 
Any extra analysis is run via "Extra_Analysis.m", or via specific functions in the Functions folders, such as "dendritic_analysis".

The toolbox is currently not optimized for a wide audience, but mostly for intenral use.
We plan to very soon update the toolbox for a much easier public utility, including every or most analysis in a single User Interface.
